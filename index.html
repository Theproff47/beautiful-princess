            <h2>Morning Routine</h2>
            <ol>
             <li><b>Cleanser</b></li> Use a gentle cleanser to remove any impurities from the night.

        </ol>
            <h2>Evening Routine</h2>
            <ol>
           <li><b>Cleanser</b> : Cleanse your skin to remove makeup, dirt, and oil accumulated throughout the day.</li>

            <li><b>Exfoliation</b></li>Exfoliate 1-2 times a week with a chemical or physical exfoliant to remove dead skin cells.
            <li><b>Face Mask</b></li> Use a face mask suited to your skin type (hydrating, clarifying, or soothing) once a week.
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2><li>Healthy Lifestyle</li></h2>
        <p class="ok"> <img src="healthy foods.jpg" alt=""><img src="exercise.jpg" alt="" id="right"><em>EXERCISING is paramount.</em>
            <br><br>Embracing a healthy lifestyle is essential for anyone wishing to radiate beauty, much like a beautiful princess in a fairytale. A princess embodies grace, confidence, and vitality, qualities that stem from nurturing both body and mind. 
<br><p class="ok">
            A balanced diet is the foundation of this lifestyle. Just as a princess selects the finest ingredients for royal feasts, you should prioritize whole foods rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Incorporating colorful fruits and vegetables not only nourishes the body but also enhances skin health, giving it a natural glow.
        </p> <br><p class="ok">
            Regular exercise is another key aspect. A princess is often depicted as active, whether dancing at royal balls or exploring her kingdom. Engaging in physical activities like dancing, yoga, or even brisk walking helps maintain a healthy weight and boosts overall mood.
        </p> <br> <p class="ok">
            Mental wellness is equally important. A true princess balances her responsibilities with self-care, practicing mindfulness and stress-relief techniques to cultivate inner peace. Surrounding oneself with positive influences and engaging in hobbies fosters joy and fulfillment.
        </p> <br> <p class="ok">
            Finally, never underestimate the power of rest. Quality sleep rejuvenates the mind and body, allowing you to wake up feeling radiant. By embracing these healthy habits, you can embody the elegance and beauty of a princess in your everyday life.
           </p> 
        </p>
        <h2><li>Personal Grooming</li></h2>
        <p class="ok"> <img src="personal grooming.jpg" alt="">Personal grooming is essential for radiating the elegance of a beautiful princess. Just as a princess meticulously prepares for royal events, establishing a grooming routine enhances your confidence and beauty. Start with skincare; clean, moisturized skin creates a glowing canvas. 
<p class="ok">
            Hair care is equally important; regular washing, conditioning, and styling keep hair healthy and lustrous, just like a princess’s flowing locks. 
        </p><p class="ok">
            Don’t forget about nails—well-manicured hands add a touch of sophistication. 
        </p> <p class="ok">
            Finally, choose fragrances that reflect your personality, leaving a lasting impression. By prioritizing personal grooming, you can embody the grace and charm of a true princess every day.
        </p>
        </p>
        <h2><li>Make-UP</li></h2>
        <p class="ok"> <img src="make up.jpg" alt="">Makeup can transform anyone into a beautiful princess by enhancing natural beauty
             with a touch of elegance and grace. Just as a princess radiates confidence and poise, the right makeup highlights your best
              features while maintaining a subtle, regal look. Start with a flawless base using a lightweight foundation, 
              followed by a soft blush to add a healthy glow. Eye makeup, with neutral shades and mascara, opens the eyes
               for a bright, enchanting gaze. Finish with a soft pink or nude lip for a polished, royal finish.
                A well-applied, simple makeup look can bring out your inner princess.
        </p>
        <h2><li>wardrobe choices</li></h2>
        <p class="ok"><img src="wardrobe.jpg" alt="">Wardrobe choices play a significant role in enhancing beauty,
             much like a beautiful princess who carefully selects her attire to reflect elegance and grace.
              A princess’s wardrobe is not just about fashion but also about showcasing her unique personality
               and confidence. Choosing outfits that flatter your body shape, complement your skin tone, and make
                you feel comfortable can transform your appearance. Just like a princess, pay attention to fabrics,
                 colors, and accessories that elevate your look. Whether it’s a flowing gown or a simple,
                  well-fitted dress, the right wardrobe can make you feel regal and effortlessly beautiful.
